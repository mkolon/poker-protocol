## Original Protocol

1. As players arrive, they are assigned a number for the night, in order of arrival. 
2. The host is always #1! Whoohoo!
3. When all seven places at the table are filled, we note the time. 
4. One hour later, #8 replaces #1, who goes to make dinner or something.
5. One hour after #9 arrives, he replaces #2, who goes to help #1 or something.
6. #1 plays again an hour after the highest waiting number clears.
7. And so on, ad infinitum.
