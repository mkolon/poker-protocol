As players arrive, they are assigned a number for the night, in order of arrival. 
The host - mkolon - is always #1! Whoohoo!
When all seven places at the table are filled, we note the time. 
One hour later, #8 replaces #1, who goes to make dinner or something.
one hour after #9 arrives, he replaces #2.
And so on, ad infinitum.
