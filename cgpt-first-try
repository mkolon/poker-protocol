I have eight friends who want to play poker for six hours. My table has seven seats. Help me devise a protocol to share the seven seats equitably. 
The game starts at 6pm. The players arrive randomly between 6pm and 7:30 pm. 
Assume we could swap in players every half-hour. Simple is best.

To organize a poker game for your eight friends with only seven seats available, while ensuring fair playing time for everyone, 
you can follow this simple protocol:

    Initial Setup (6:00 PM - 6:30 PM):
        As players arrive, let them join the game immediately.
        If more than seven players have arrived by 6:30 PM, randomly select seven to begin playing.

    Rotating Players (Every Half-Hour from 6:30 PM):
        At 6:30 PM and every half-hour thereafter, pause the game briefly to rotate players.
        Use a simple rotation system where the player who has been playing the longest (or if there's a tie, select randomly among them) vacates their seat for a player who is waiting.
        Ensure everyone knows when they arrived, so you can track who has been playing the longest.

    Equalizing Play Time:
        Keep a basic record (like a simple list or chart) of when each player started and stopped playing.
        This will help you ensure that everyone gets approximately the same amount of play time by the end of the night.

    Final Hours (11:00 PM - Midnight):
        By the last hour or two, start checking your list to see if anyone needs more time to equalize their play.
        Make the necessary adjustments so that by midnight, everyone has had roughly the same amount of playtime.

    Flexibility and Communication:
        Be flexible and communicate with your friends. If someone doesn't mind sitting out longer, adjust accordingly.
        Keep the atmosphere friendly and cooperative to ensure everyone enjoys the evening.

This protocol balances fairness with simplicity and should ensure that everyone gets to play a roughly equal amount of time without making the logistics too complex.
